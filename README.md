# Capstone-Project

Capstone project is about the Attenance using Face Recognition where the face can be recogized from taking the image in real time.

This project is about taking attendance using your face as a identity with the help of Convolutional Neural Network instead of the biometric system.

I created a Attendance Face-Recognition application in Python using Keras and OpenCV where the user have to place the face in front of the camera using VGG Face as a classifier for face recognition and attendance will be added accordingly.

In this project, I will be using VGG-Face Model for face recognition which was built under VGG16 architecture which was University of Oxford using Keras.

Files:
  1. dataset is the file whihc contains the images of the user
  2. faceVGG is the file which contains the programs to run the application 
    1. generate.py is the generation of the new images
    2. face_recogize.py is the image preprocessing and recognition of the face in real-time camera
    3. vgg.py is the architecture of the neural network

Please read .pdf file for the documentation of the project.
